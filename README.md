This analysis used the R programming language to explore the iris dataset and perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). After loading the dataset, its structure and summary statistics were examined to understand the distribution of the four numerical variables. The species column was excluded because it was categorical, and the remaining variables were standardised to ensure they contributed equally to the PCA. A PCA model was fitted using prcomp, and the eigenvalues, loadings, and component structure were reviewed. A scree plot was generated to show the proportion of variance explained by each principal component, followed by a biplot to visualise how variables contributed to components. Finally, the PCA object was inspected to confirm its structure and outputs.
