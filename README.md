This analysis uses the R programming language to explore the iris dataset and perform Principal Component Analysis (PCA). After loading the dataset, its structure and summary statistics are examined to understand the distribution of the four numerical variables. The species column is excluded because it is categorical, and the remaining variables are standardised to ensure they contribute equally to the PCA. A PCA model is then fitted using prcomp, and the eigenvalues, loadings, and component structure are reviewed. A screen plot is generated to show the proportion of variance explained by each principal component, followed by a biplot to visualise how variables contribute to components. Finally, the PCA object is inspected to confirm its structure and outputs.
